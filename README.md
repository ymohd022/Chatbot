Chatbot Using NLP
📄 Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries and providing meaningful responses, simulating a conversational interface. This project can be expanded to include domain-specific applications or enhance user engagement through integration with platforms like websites or apps.

🌟 Features
Text-based conversational chatbot.
Natural Language Processing for understanding user inputs.
Easy integration with front-end or communication platforms.
Modular and scalable architecture for additional features.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-learn
Flask (for integration if applicable)
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook/VS Code
